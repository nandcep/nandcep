### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

An Apple fanboy who is wondering to become an enterprise application expert. 
Spelling a bad mantra through code editor.

As a game changer for more than 12 years in informatics engineering which have been applied on many industries, my specializations are in technical consulting, digital platform, and integration / middleware. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on PT. Telekomunikasi Selular (Telkomsel) as DevSecOps Enabler
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m reactively speaking in C++, Go, Java, and Javascript with its various components 
- ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source tools, CI/CD automation, and cloud development
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am writing a code only for special occasion

Stack and tech that I'm working on Github related to my past, working context, and hobby.
