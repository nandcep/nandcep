### 👋 Hi there, just call me Adi or Nandra

An Apple fanboy who is wondering to become an enterprise application expert. 
Spelling a bad mantra through code editor. 

As a game changer for more than 10 years in informatics engineering which have been applied on many industries, my specializations are in technical consulting, digital platform, and integration / middleware. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Indonesian wireless network provider PT. Telekomunikasi Selular (Telkomsel) as IT Architect for DevSecOps Program
- 🌱 I’m reactively speaking in C++, Go, Java, and Javascript with its various components 
- 💡 I’m looking to collaborate on open source tools, CI/CD automation, and cloud development
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am writing a code only for special occasion

Stack and tech that I'm working on Github related to my past, working context, and hobby.
